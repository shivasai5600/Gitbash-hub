Here is the **clear difference** between:

### ✅ **A. What you wrote earlier (simple push method)**

and

### ✅ **B. The PR flow you listed now (pull-request workflow for teams)**

---

# 🚀 **A. Simple Push Method (personal work / your own repo)**

You used this earlier:

1. Create a folder
2. `git init`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "message"`
5. `git push -u origin main`
6. Continue updating with:

   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "message"`
   * `git push`

### ✔️ Purpose:

* For **your own** repository
* No review process
* You directly push to `main`

### ✔️ Good for:

* Learning
* Personal projects
* Small solo work

---

# 🧑‍💻 **B. PR (Pull Request) Workflow — for Team, Collaboration, Code Review**

Your steps:

1. `git clone URL`
2. `cd <project-folder>`
3. `git pull`
4. `git checkout -b new_branch_name` → **create your feature branch**
5. `git pull origin master` (or `main`)
6. `git add .`
7. `git status`
8. `git commit -m "message"`
9. `git push`
10. Go to GitHub
11. Create PR (compare & pull request)
12. Review → merge to main

### ✔️ Purpose:

* Used in **professional projects**
* You **never push directly to main**
* You create a **feature branch**
* You raise a **PR for code review**
* Someone reviews → approves → merges

### ✔️ Good for:

* Team collaboration
* Avoid breaking main code
* Code quality and reviewing
* CI/CD checks

| Feature             | Simple Push       | PR Workflow                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Creating branch     | ❌ No              | ✔️ Yes (`git checkout -b branch`) |
| Code review         | ❌ No              | ✔️ Yes                            |
| Direct push to main | ✔️ Yes            | ❌ Not allowed                     |
| Used for            | Personal projects | Team/company projects             |
| Safety              | Low               | High (checks, review)             |
| Steps               | Few               | More steps                        |
| Merge process       | Automatic         | Manual review + merge             |

# 🎯 Summary

### **Your earlier method = Direct push to main.**

### **Your new method = Professional workflow using PR, branches & reviews.**

Both are correct — but used for **different purposes**.
