# ⭐ **Perfect Interview Answer (25 Seconds)**

**“As an automation engineer, I use TestRail to manage and track all automated and manual test cases.
Inside the dashboard, I navigate through Projects, Suites, and Test Runs to understand coverage and execution status.
I link automated test scripts to test cases, upload results through the TestRail API, monitor pass/fail trends, attach logs/screenshots, and generate reports.
I also work with milestones and integrate TestRail with Jenkins and Jira for end-to-end traceability.”**
